This mod is made to extract data from GTA V enviroment and simulate two cameras.

## Using the mod

Take the files in the "Compiled files" folder and copy them to the "scripts" folder in your GTA V directory. 
You need to add a "path.txt" with the directory where you want the json file and the images captures to be saved.
In that directory you will need to add the "data_file.json" file.


### Prerequisites

```

```

In Python you will need:

```
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
pip install pypiwin32
```

For getting the data just use the "Collect Mod Data.py" script. You will need a json file called 'data_file.json' first which will be generated by the mod.

While using the mod if automatically doesn't start (It just work when you are in a car) press the key "Insert".

To start the second camera simulation(then you only can drive with the help of the python script) press "X"
